## About

This is my first small project to get hands-on with API and learn about SQL. It uses SQLite C++ API to be able to write C++ code to perform SQL-type database tasks. It can create a db file that can insert, delete, and update existing data. 

Originally I didn't have any particular interest in databases when starting this project but after working with it and learning SQL, it became something I am interested to keep working on.
